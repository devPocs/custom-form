# custom-form
Creates a custom form for conference attendees.
Allows attendees to upload receipts of their payment. 
Admins can verify the payments. An automated email is sent after payment is confirmed.
This does well for small businesses which do not need to go through the hassle of getting a payment gateway implemented.
